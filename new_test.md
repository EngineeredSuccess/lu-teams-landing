Headline: The Precision Instrument for Engineering Synergy
Sub-headline: Stop guessing with surface-level personality tests. LU Teams uses deep HEXACO metrics and Team Role Dynamics to predict synergy and prevent mission-critical friction.
Section: Why Engineering Leaders Choose LU Teams
You didn't become a technical leader to manage "office politics." You got here because you solve complex problems. But a single "brilliant but toxic" engineer or a team of five visionaries with zero "finishers" can sink a $10M project.

LU Teams provides the data layer for your human stack.

Section: Our Methodology (The HEXACO + Roles Advantage)
Instead of generic DiSC or Gallup profiles, we utilize the most scientifically robust framework for high-stakes environments:

HEXACO Deep-Core Analysis: We go beyond the surface. By measuring the Honesty-Humility (H) factor, we identify high-integrity leaders and flag potential "toxic brilliance" before it disrupts your culture.

Engineering Team Roles: Our AI analyzes how individuals function within a technical machine. Do you have enough Architects to design, Optimizers to refine, and Finishers to ship?

The Synergy Radar: We don't just show you individual scores. Our engine maps how two engineers will actually collaborate during a high-pressure sprint or a complex code review.

Section: Industry-Specific Solutions
🚀 Aerospace & Defense
In mission-critical engineering, "Integrity" isn't a buzzword—it's a safety requirement. Our HEXACO-based modeling ensures your team has the emotional stability and conscientiousness required for zero-fail environments.

💻 High-Velocity Tech & SaaS
Bad chemistry is a bug that scales. LU Teams helps you optimize your "human API," ensuring that your senior architects and junior developers are matched for maximum knowledge transfer and minimum friction.

🏭 Advanced Manufacturing
Coordinate across mechanical, electrical, and software silos. Our Team Role analysis ensures that cross-functional dependencies are managed by people whose profiles naturally bridge communication gaps.

Section: Features that Drive ROI
Conflict Prediction: Identify where "clashes in cognitive style" will occur before the first line of code is written.

Hiring Calibration: Don't just hire for skill; hire for the missing piece in your team's "Synergy Radar."

Automated Retrospectives: Use personality data to understand why a sprint failed and how to reconfigure for the next one.

LU Teams utilizes an independent methodology based on the HEXACO-PI-R and open-source Team Role models. We provide data-driven insights, not just labels.
